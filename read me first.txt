This project uses the following frameworks:
DataDriver
Junit

And we used Maven.

The program bascially navigates and books a ticket through Flyus.com. 

Inputs required to fill text boxes in the website were taken from an excel sheet.

Final price of the ticket is fetched from the website and recorded in an excel sheet.

Many small modules were written and tested using Junit.

And the important steps during the ticket booking were taken screenshot.
